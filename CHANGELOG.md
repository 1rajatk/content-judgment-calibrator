## Internal Calibration Update

- Refined credibility calibration for evidence-light, external-facing content
- Normalized detection of reassurance framing as a structural risk signal
- Improved internal vs external context handling (no false defensive reads for internal memos)
- Preserved original CJC analysis format and output structure
- Go / Revise / Hold / No-Go publishing gate retained without change
