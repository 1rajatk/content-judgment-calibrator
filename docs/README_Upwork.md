Here is a **clean, client-facing `README_Upwork.md`**, written specifically for **Upwork’s scanning behavior** and decision psychology.

It is:

* Short enough to read
* Concrete enough to trust
* Distinct from the GitHub README
* Free of academic or “tool-builder” tone

You can paste this **verbatim** into `docs/README_Upwork.md`.

### Content Judgment Calibrator

I build systems that **evaluate AI-assisted content**, not rewrite it.

This project is a **Content Judgment Calibrator**—a tool I use to assess whether content *holds together* across **clarity**, **credibility**, and **intent alignment**, especially when AI is involved.

---

### What This Does

The calibrator reviews text and:

* Scores **Clarity**, **Credibility**, and **Intent Alignment** (0–5)
* Flags structural risks such as:

  * persuasion bias
  * inflated or vague claims
  * urgency framing
  * tone drift
* Explains *why* a judgment holds, without editing the content

It does **not**:

* Rewrite or optimize copy
* Suggest marketing improvements
* Push engagement, SEO, or conversion tactics

This makes it useful as a **sanity check** before content goes live.

---

### When This Is Useful

I use this system when working on:

* AI-generated marketing drafts
* Advisory or thought-leadership content
* Product narratives and launch messaging
* Internal documentation and policy-adjacent text

Anywhere clarity and credibility matter more than hype.

---

### How I Demo It

I typically demo the calibrator with two short texts:

* one persuasion-heavy
* one data-driven and scoped

Both are evaluated independently to show how judgment shifts based on framing—not polish.

This helps teams see:

* where content sounds confident but isn’t credible
* where limits are acknowledged responsibly
* how intent and tone can drift unnoticed

---

### Why This Matters

As AI accelerates content creation, **judgment becomes the bottleneck**.

This tool helps:

* catch overstatement early
* reduce credibility risk
* keep intent aligned as content scales

It’s not about making content louder.
It’s about making it **trustworthy**.

### How to Use This on Upwork

If you’re considering working together:

* Share a short sample of content
* I’ll walk you through how it’s evaluated
* We’ll discuss what the judgment reveals

No rewrites. No pressure. Just clarity.
